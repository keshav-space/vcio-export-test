aliases: []
summary: In the BN_hex2bn function the number of hex digits is calculated using an int value
  |i|. Later |bn_expand| is called with a value of |i * 4|. For large values of |i| this can
  result in |bn_expand| not allocating any memory because |i * 4| is negative. This can leave
  the internal BIGNUM data field as NULL leading to a subsequent NULL ptr deref. For very large
  values of |i|, the calculation |i * 4| could be a positive value smaller than |i|. In this
  case memory is allocated to the internal BIGNUM data field, but it is insufficiently sized
  leading to heap corruption. A similar issue exists in BN_dec2bn. This could have security
  consequences if BN_hex2bn/BN_dec2bn is ever called by user applications with very large untrusted
  hex/dec data. This is anticipated to be a rare occurrence. All OpenSSL internal usage of these
  functions use data that is not expected to be untrusted, e.g. config file data or application
  command line arguments. If user developed applications generate config file data based on
  untrusted data then it is possible that this could also lead to security consequences. This
  is also anticipated to be rare.
