summary: An overflow can occur in the EVP_EncryptUpdate() function. If an attacker is able to
  supply very large amounts of input data after a previous call to EVP_EncryptUpdate() with
  a partial block then a length check can overflow resulting in a heap corruption. Following
  an analysis of all OpenSSL internal usage of the EVP_EncryptUpdate() function all usage is
  one of two forms. The first form is where the EVP_EncryptUpdate() call is known to be the
  first called function after an EVP_EncryptInit(), and therefore that specific call must be
  safe. The second form is where the length passed to EVP_EncryptUpdate() can be seen from the
  code to be some small value and therefore there is no possibility of an overflow. Since all
  instances are one of these two forms, it is believed that there can be no overflows in internal
  code due to this problem. It should be noted that EVP_DecryptUpdate() can call EVP_EncryptUpdate()
  in certain code paths. Also EVP_CipherUpdate() is a synonym for EVP_EncryptUpdate(). All instances
  of these calls have also been analysed too and it is believed there are no instances in internal
  usage where an overflow could occur. This could still represent a security issue for end user
  code that calls this function directly.
