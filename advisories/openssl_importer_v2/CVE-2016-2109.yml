aliases: []
summary: When ASN.1 data is read from a BIO using functions such as d2i_CMS_bio() a short invalid
  encoding can casuse allocation of large amounts of memory potentially consuming excessive
  resources or exhausting memory. Any application parsing untrusted data through d2i BIO functions
  is affected. The memory based functions such as d2i_X509() are *not* affected. Since the memory
  based functions are used by the TLS library, TLS applications are not affected.
