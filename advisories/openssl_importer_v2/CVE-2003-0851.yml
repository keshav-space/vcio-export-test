aliases: []
summary: A flaw in OpenSSL 0.9.6k (only) would cause certain ASN.1 sequences to trigger a large
  recursion. On platforms such as Windows this large recursion cannot be handled correctly and
  so the bug causes OpenSSL to crash. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw if they can
  send arbitrary ASN.1 sequences which would cause OpenSSL to crash. This could be performed
  for example by sending a client certificate to a SSL/TLS enabled server which is configured
  to accept them.
