aliases: []
summary: The signature verification routines will crash with a NULL pointer dereference if presented
  with an ASN.1 signature using the RSA PSS algorithm and absent mask generation function parameter.
  Since these routines are used to verify certificate signature algorithms this can be used
  to crash any certificate verification operation and exploited in a DoS attack. Any application
  which performs certificate verification is vulnerable including OpenSSL clients and servers
  which enable client authentication.
