  POLY1305 MAC implementation corrupts XMM registers on Windows
  Issue summary: The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation
  contains a bug that might corrupt the internal state of applications on the
  Windows 64 platform when running on newer X86_64 processors supporting the
  AVX512-IFMA instructions.

  Impact summary: If in an application that uses the OpenSSL library an attacker
  can influence whether the POLY1305 MAC algorithm is used, the application
  state might be corrupted with various application dependent consequences.

  The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation in OpenSSL does
  not save the contents of non-volatile XMM registers on Windows 64 platform
  when calculating the MAC of data larger than 64 bytes. Before returning to
  the caller all the XMM registers are set to zero rather than restoring their
  previous content. The vulnerable code is used only on newer x86_64 processors
  supporting the AVX512-IFMA instructions.

  The consequences of this kind of internal application state corruption can
  be various - from no consequences, if the calling application does not
  depend on the contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worst
  consequences, where the attacker could get complete control of the application
  process. However given the contents of the registers are just zeroized so
  the attacker cannot put arbitrary values inside, the most likely consequence,
  if any, would be an incorrect result of some application dependent
  calculations or a crash leading to a denial of service.

  The POLY1305 MAC algorithm is most frequently used as part of the
  CHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated data)
  algorithm. The most common usage of this AEAD cipher is with TLS protocol
  versions 1.2 and 1.3 and a malicious client can influence whether this AEAD
  cipher is used by the server. This implies that server applications using
  OpenSSL can be potentially impacted. However we are currently not aware of
  any concrete application that would be affected by this issue therefore we
  consider this a Low severity security issue.

  As a workaround the AVX512-IFMA instructions support can be disabled at
  runtime by setting the environment variable OPENSSL_ia32cap:

     OPENSSL_ia32cap=:~0x200000

  The FIPS provider is not affected by this issue.
