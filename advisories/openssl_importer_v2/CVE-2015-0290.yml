aliases: []
summary: Multiblock corrupted pointer. OpenSSL 1.0.2 introduced the "multiblock" performance
  improvement. This feature only applies on 64 bit x86 architecture platforms that support AES
  NI instructions. A defect in the implementation of "multiblock" can cause OpenSSL's internal
  write buffer to become incorrectly set to NULL when using non-blocking IO. Typically, when
  the user application is using a socket BIO for writing, this will only result in a failed
  connection. However if some other BIO is used then it is likely that a segmentation fault
  will be triggered, thus enabling a potential DoS attack.
