summary: 'This issue only affected versions of OpenSSL prior to March 19th 2015 at which time
  the code was refactored to address vulnerability CVE-2015-0293. s2_srvr.c did not enforce
  that clear-key-length is 0 for non-export ciphers. If clear-key bytes are present for these
  ciphers, they *displace* encrypted-key bytes. This leads to an efficient divide-and-conquer
  key recovery attack: if an eavesdropper has intercepted an SSLv2 handshake, they can use the
  server as an oracle to determine the SSLv2 master-key, using only 16 connections to the server
  and negligible computation. More importantly, this leads to a more efficient version of DROWN
  that is effective against non-export ciphersuites, and requires no significant computation.'
