aliases: []
summary: A crash was found affecting SRP ciphersuites used in a Server Hello message. The issue
  affects OpenSSL clients and allows a malicious server to crash the client with a null pointer
  dereference (read) by specifying an SRP ciphersuite even though it was not properly negotiated
  with the client. This could lead to a Denial of Service.
