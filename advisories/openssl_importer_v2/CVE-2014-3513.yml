aliases: []
summary: A flaw in the DTLS SRTP extension parsing code allows an attacker, who sends a carefully
  crafted handshake message, to cause OpenSSL to fail to free up to 64k of memory causing a
  memory leak. This could be exploited in a Denial Of Service attack. This issue affects OpenSSL
  1.0.1 server implementations for both SSL/TLS and DTLS regardless of whether SRTP is used
  or configured. Implementations of OpenSSL that have been compiled with OPENSSL_NO_SRTP defined
  are not affected.
