aliases: []
summary: When a malformed ASN1 structure is received it's contents are freed up and zeroed and
  an error condition returned. On a small number of platforms where sizeof(long) < sizeof(void
  *) (for example WIN64) this can cause an invalid memory access later resulting in a crash
  when some invalid structures are read, for example RSA public keys.
