aliases: []
summary: The PRNG implementation for the OpenSSL FIPS Object Module 1.1.1 does not perform auto-seeding
  during the FIPS self-test, which generates random data that is more predictable than expected
  and makes it easier for attackers to bypass protection mechanisms that rely on the randomness.
