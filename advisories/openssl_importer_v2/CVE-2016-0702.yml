summary: A side-channel attack was found which makes use of cache-bank conflicts on the Intel
  Sandy-Bridge microarchitecture which could lead to the recovery of RSA keys. The ability to
  exploit this issue is limited as it relies on an attacker who has control of code in a thread
  running on the same hyper-threaded core as the victim thread which is performing decryptions.
