aliases: []
summary: The Raccoon attack exploits a flaw in the TLS specification which can lead to an attacker
  being able to compute the pre-master secret in connections which have used a Diffie-Hellman
  (DH) based ciphersuite. In such a case this would result in the attacker being able to eavesdrop
  on all encrypted communications sent over that TLS connection. The attack can only be exploited
  if an implementation re-uses a DH secret across multiple TLS connections. Note that this issue
  only impacts DH ciphersuites and not ECDH ciphersuites. This issue affects OpenSSL 1.0.2 which
  is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. OpenSSL 1.1.1 is not vulnerable
  to this issue.
