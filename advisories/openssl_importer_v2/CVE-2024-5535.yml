  SSL_select_next_proto buffer overread
  Issue summary: Calling the OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto with an
  empty supported client protocols buffer may cause a crash or memory contents to
  be sent to the peer.

  Impact summary: A buffer overread can have a range of potential consequences
  such as unexpected application beahviour or a crash. In particular this issue
  could result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sent
  to the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applications
  that directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of
  supported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally never
  be a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur by
  accident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the calling
  application.

  The OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto is typically used by TLS
  applications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN
  (Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised and
  is deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly more
  widely deployed than NPN. The SSL_select_next_proto function accepts a list of
  protocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returns
  the first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in the
  client list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns the
  first item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlap
  between the two lists was found. In the case where SSL_select_next_proto is
  called with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition and
  returns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reports
  that there was no overlap in the lists).

  This function is typically called from a server side application callback for
  ALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the list
  of protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero in
  length. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should never
  normally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if the
  SSL_select_next_proto function has been called as expected (with the list
  supplied by the client passed in the client/client_len parameters), then the
  application will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application has
  accidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and has
  accidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client_len
  parameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a "no overlap"
  response (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then it
  will be vulnerable to this problem.

  In the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically select
  a protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocol
  in the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comes
  from the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length.
  However if the SSL_select_next_proto function is accidentally called with a
  client_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead. If the
  application uses this output as the opportunistic protocol then the loss of
  confidentiality will occur.

  This issue has been assessed as Low severity because applications are most
  likely to be vulnerable if they are using NPN instead of ALPN - but NPN is not
  widely used. It also requires an application configuration or programming error.
  Finally, this issue would not typically be under attacker control making active
  exploitation unlikely.

  The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.

  Due to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing new releases of
  OpenSSL at this time. The fix will be included in the next releases when they
  become available.
