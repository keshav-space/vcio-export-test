summary: Segmentation fault in DTLSv1_listen. A defect in the implementation of DTLSv1_listen
  means that state is preserved in the SSL object from one invocation to the next that can lead
  to a segmentation fault. Errors processing the initial ClientHello can trigger this scenario.
  An example of such an error could be that a DTLS1.0 only client is attempting to connect to
  a DTLS1.2 only server.
