aliases: []
summary: 'An overflow can occur in the EVP_EncodeUpdate() function which is used for Base64
  encoding of binary data. If an attacker is able to supply very large amounts of input data
  then a length check can overflow resulting in a heap corruption. Internally to OpenSSL the
  EVP_EncodeUpdate() function is primarly used by the PEM_write_bio* family of functions. These
  are mainly used within the OpenSSL command line applications. These internal uses are not
  considered vulnerable because all calls are bounded with length checks so no overflow is possible.
  User applications that call these APIs directly with large amounts of untrusted data may be
  vulnerable. (Note: Initial analysis suggested that the PEM_write_bio* were vulnerable, and
  this is reflected in the patch commit message. This is no longer believed to be the case).'
