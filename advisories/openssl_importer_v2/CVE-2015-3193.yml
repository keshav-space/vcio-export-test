aliases: []
summary: There is a carry propagating bug in the x86_64 Montgomery squaring procedure. No EC
  algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of
  this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against
  DH are considered just feasible (although very difficult) because most of the work necessary
  to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources
  required for such an attack would be very significant and likely only accessible to a limited
  number of attackers. An attacker would additionally need online access to an unpatched system
  using the target private key in a scenario with persistent DH parameters and a private key
  that is shared between multiple clients. For example this can occur by default in OpenSSL
  DHE based SSL/TLS ciphersuites.
