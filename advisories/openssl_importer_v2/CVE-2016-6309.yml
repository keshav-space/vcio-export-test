summary: This issue only affects OpenSSL 1.1.0a, released on 22nd September 2016. The patch
  applied to address CVE-2016-6307 resulted in an issue where if a message larger than approx
  16k is received then the underlying buffer to store the incoming message is reallocated and
  moved. Unfortunately a dangling pointer to the old location is left which results in an attempt
  to write to the previously freed location. This is likely to result in a crash, however it
  could potentially lead to execution of arbitrary code.
