summary: A MITM attacker can use a padding oracle attack to decrypt traffic when the connection
  uses an AES CBC cipher and the server support AES-NI. This issue was introduced as part of
  the fix for Lucky 13 padding attack (CVE-2013-0169). The padding check was rewritten to be
  in constant time by making sure that always the same bytes are read and compared against either
  the MAC or padding bytes. But it no longer checked that there was enough data to have both
  the MAC and padding bytes.
