summary: |
  NULL dereference during PKCS7 data verification
  A NULL pointer can be dereferenced when signatures are being
  verified on PKCS7 signed or signedAndEnveloped data. In case the hash
  algorithm used for the signature is known to the OpenSSL library but
  the implementation of the hash algorithm is not available the digest
  initialization will fail. There is a missing check for the return
  value from the initialization function which later leads to invalid
  usage of the digest API most likely leading to a crash.

  The unavailability of an algorithm can be caused by using FIPS
  enabled configuration of providers or more commonly by not loading
  the legacy provider.

  PKCS7 data is processed by the SMIME library calls and also by the
  time stamp (TS) library calls. The TLS implementation in OpenSSL does
  not call these functions however third party applications would be
  affected if they call these functions to verify signatures on untrusted
  data.
