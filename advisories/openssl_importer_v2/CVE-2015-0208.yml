aliases: []
summary: Segmentation fault for invalid PSS parameters. The signature verification routines
  will crash with a NULL pointer dereference if presented with an ASN.1 signature using the
  RSA PSS algorithm and invalid parameters. Since these routines are used to verify certificate
  signature algorithms this can be used to crash any certificate verification operation and
  exploited in a DoS attack. Any application which performs certificate verification is vulnerable
  including OpenSSL clients and servers which enable client authentication.
