aliases: []
summary: A flaw in the DTLS replay attack protection mechanism means that records that arrive
  for future epochs update the replay protection "window" before the MAC for the record has
  been validated. This could be exploited by an attacker by sending a record for the next epoch
  (which does not have to decrypt or have a valid MAC), with a very large sequence number. This
  means that all subsequent legitimate packets are dropped causing a denial of service for a
  specific DTLS connection.
