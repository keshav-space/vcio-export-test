aliases: []
summary: The Google Security Team discovered several functions inside OpenSSL incorrectly checked
  the result after calling the EVP_VerifyFinal function, allowing a malformed signature to be
  treated as a good signature rather than as an error. This issue affected the signature checks
  on DSA and ECDSA keys used with SSL/TLS. One way to exploit this flaw would be for a remote
  attacker who is in control of a malicious server or who can use a 'man in the middle' attack
  to present a malformed SSL/TLS signature from a certificate chain to a vulnerable client,
  bypassing validation.
