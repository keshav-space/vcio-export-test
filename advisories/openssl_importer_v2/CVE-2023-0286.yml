summary: |
  X.400 address type confusion in X.509 GeneralName
  There is a type confusion vulnerability relating to X.400 address processing
  inside an X.509 GeneralName. X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1_STRING but
  the public structure definition for GENERAL_NAME incorrectly specified the type
  of the x400Address field as ASN1_TYPE. This field is subsequently interpreted by
  the OpenSSL function GENERAL_NAME_cmp as an ASN1_TYPE rather than an
  ASN1_STRING.

  When CRL checking is enabled (i.e. the application sets the
  X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK flag), this vulnerability may allow an attacker to pass
  arbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling them to read memory contents or
  enact a denial of service. In most cases, the attack requires the attacker to
  provide both the certificate chain and CRL, neither of which need to have a
  valid signature. If the attacker only controls one of these inputs, the other
  input must already contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point, which
  is uncommon. As such, this vulnerability is most likely to only affect
  applications which have implemented their own functionality for retrieving CRLs
  over a network.
