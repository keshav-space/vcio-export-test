aliases: []
summary: Operations in the DSA signing algorithm should run in constant time in order to avoid
  side channel attacks. A flaw in the OpenSSL DSA implementation means that a non-constant time
  codepath is followed for certain operations. This has been demonstrated through a cache-timing
  attack to be sufficient for an attacker to recover the private DSA key.
