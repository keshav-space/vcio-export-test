summary: 'Avoid some undefined pointer arithmetic A common idiom in the codebase is to check
  limits in the following manner: "p + len > limit" Where "p" points to some malloc''d data
  of SIZE bytes and limit == p + SIZE "len" here could be from some externally supplied data
  (e.g. from a TLS message). The rules of C pointer arithmetic are such that "p + len" is only
  well defined where len <= SIZE. Therefore the above idiom is actually undefined behaviour.
  For example this could cause problems if some malloc implementation provides an address for
  "p" such that "p + len" actually overflows for values of len that are too big and therefore
  p + len < limit.'
