aliases: []
summary: Under certain circumstances OpenSSL's internal certificate verification routines can
  incorrectly accept a CRL whose nextUpdate field is in the past. Applications are only affected
  by the CRL checking vulnerability if they enable OpenSSL's internal CRL checking which is
  off by default. Applications which use their own custom CRL checking (such as Apache) are
  not affected.
