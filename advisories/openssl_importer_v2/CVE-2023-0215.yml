summary: |
  Use-after-free following BIO_new_NDEF
  The public API function BIO_new_NDEF is a helper function used for streaming
  ASN.1 data via a BIO. It is primarily used internally to OpenSSL to support the
  SMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities, but may also be called directly by
  end user applications.

  The function receives a BIO from the caller, prepends a new BIO_f_asn1 filter
  BIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns the new head of
  the BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions, for example if a CMS
  recipient public key is invalid, the new filter BIO is freed and the function
  returns a NULL result indicating a failure. However, in this case, the BIO chain
  is not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains
  internal pointers to the previously freed filter BIO. If the caller then goes on
  to call BIO_pop() on the BIO then a use-after-free will occur. This will most
  likely result in a crash.



  This scenario occurs directly in the internal function B64_write_ASN1() which
  may cause BIO_new_NDEF() to be called and will subsequently call BIO_pop() on
  the BIO. This internal function is in turn called by the public API functions
  PEM_write_bio_ASN1_stream, PEM_write_bio_CMS_stream, PEM_write_bio_PKCS7_stream,
  SMIME_write_ASN1, SMIME_write_CMS and SMIME_write_PKCS7.

  Other public API functions that may be impacted by this include
  i2d_ASN1_bio_stream, BIO_new_CMS, BIO_new_PKCS7, i2d_CMS_bio_stream and
  i2d_PKCS7_bio_stream.

  The OpenSSL cms and smime command line applications are similarly affected.
