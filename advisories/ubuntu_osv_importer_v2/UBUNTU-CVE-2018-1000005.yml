summary: 'libcurl 7.49.0 to and including 7.57.0 contains an out bounds read in code handling
  HTTP/2 trailers. It was reported (https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/2231) that reading an
  HTTP/2 trailer could mess up future trailers since the stored size was one byte less than
  required. The problem is that the code that creates HTTP/1-like headers from the HTTP/2 trailer
  data once appended a string like `:` to the target buffer, while this was recently changed
  to `: ` (a space was added after the colon) but the following math wasn''t updated correspondingly.
  When accessed, the data is read out of bounds and causes either a crash or that the (too large)
  data gets passed to client write. This could lead to a denial-of-service situation or an information
  disclosure if someone has a service that echoes back or uses the trailers for something.'
