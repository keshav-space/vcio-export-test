  - CVE-2022-36062
summary: Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. In versions prior
  to 8.5.13, 9.0.9, and 9.1.6, Grafana is subject to Improper Preservation of Permissions resulting
  in privilege escalation on some folders where Admin is the only used permission. The vulnerability
  impacts Grafana instances where RBAC was disabled and enabled afterwards, as the migrations
  which are translating legacy folder permissions to RBAC permissions do not account for the
  scenario where the only user permission in the folder is Admin, as a result RBAC adds permissions
  for Editors and Viewers which allow them to edit and view folders accordingly. This issue
  has been patched in versions 8.5.13, 9.0.9, and 9.1.6. A workaround when the impacted folder/dashboard
  is known is to remove the additional permissions manually.
