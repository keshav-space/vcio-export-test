summary: 'The OpenSSL 3.0 implementation of the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite incorrectly uses the AAD
  data as the MAC key. This makes the MAC key trivially predictable. An attacker could exploit
  this issue by performing a man-in-the-middle attack to modify data being sent from one endpoint
  to an OpenSSL 3.0 recipient such that the modified data would still pass the MAC integrity
  check. Note that data sent from an OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint to a non-OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint will
  always be rejected by the recipient and the connection will fail at that point. Many application
  protocols require data to be sent from the client to the server first. Therefore, in such
  a case, only an OpenSSL 3.0 server would be impacted when talking to a non-OpenSSL 3.0 client.
  If both endpoints are OpenSSL 3.0 then the attacker could modify data being sent in both directions.
  In this case both clients and servers could be affected, regardless of the application protocol.
  Note that in the absence of an attacker this bug means that an OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint communicating
  with a non-OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint will fail to complete the handshake when using this ciphersuite.
  The confidentiality of data is not impacted by this issue, i.e. an attacker cannot decrypt
  data that has been encrypted using this ciphersuite - they can only modify it. In order for
  this attack to work both endpoints must legitimately negotiate the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite. This
  ciphersuite is not compiled by default in OpenSSL 3.0, and is not available within the default
  provider or the default ciphersuite list. This ciphersuite will never be used if TLSv1.3 has
  been negotiated. In order for an OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint to use this ciphersuite the following
  must have occurred: 1) OpenSSL must have been compiled with the (non-default) compile time
  option enable-weak-ssl-ciphers 2) OpenSSL must have had the legacy provider explicitly loaded
  (either through application code or via configuration) 3) The ciphersuite must have been explicitly
  added to the ciphersuite list 4) The libssl security level must have been set to 0 (default
  is 1) 5) A version of SSL/TLS below TLSv1.3 must have been negotiated 6) Both endpoints must
  negotiate the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite in preference to any others that both endpoints have in
  common Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.3 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2).'
