  - CVE-2018-12891
summary: An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.10.x. Certain PV MMU operations may take a
  long time to process. For that reason Xen explicitly checks for the need to preempt the current
  vCPU at certain points. A few rarely taken code paths did bypass such checks. By suitably
  enforcing the conditions through its own page table contents, a malicious guest may cause
  such bypasses to be used for an unbounded number of iterations. A malicious or buggy PV guest
  may cause a Denial of Service (DoS) affecting the entire host. Specifically, it may prevent
  use of a physical CPU for an indeterminate period of time. All Xen versions from 3.4 onwards
  are vulnerable. Xen versions 3.3 and earlier are vulnerable to an even wider class of attacks,
  due to them lacking preemption checks altogether in the affected code paths. Only x86 systems
  are affected. ARM systems are not affected. Only multi-vCPU x86 PV guests can leverage the
  vulnerability. x86 HVM or PVH guests as well as x86 single-vCPU PV ones cannot leverage the
  vulnerability.
