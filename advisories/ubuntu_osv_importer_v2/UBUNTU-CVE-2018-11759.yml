aliases:
  - CVE-2018-11759
summary: The Apache Web Server (httpd) specific code that normalised the requested path before
  matching it to the URI-worker map in Apache Tomcat JK (mod_jk) Connector 1.2.0 to 1.2.44 did
  not handle some edge cases correctly. If only a sub-set of the URLs supported by Tomcat were
  exposed via httpd, then it was possible for a specially constructed request to expose application
  functionality through the reverse proxy that was not intended for clients accessing the application
  via the reverse proxy. It was also possible in some configurations for a specially constructed
  request to bypass the access controls configured in httpd. While there is some overlap between
  this issue and CVE-2018-1323, they are not identical.
